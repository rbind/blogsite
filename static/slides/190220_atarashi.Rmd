# Project Plan

Use predicted secondary-structure information to improve RNA **Multiple sequence alignment**


---

# Background

- Functional RNAs appear to maintain base-paired structure rather than primary sequence. 
    - accurate multiple alignment relies on accurate secondary structure prediction
    - and vice versa
--

- Existing alignemnt strategies
    - Guide Tree: ClustalW, MUSCLE, MAFFT, 
    - Hidden Markov models: FSA, PRANK
    - CM: HMM extended to tree structures

---

# Background (2) CM

- Covariance model (Infernal)  
--

    - describes both the secondary structure and primary sequence consensus of a RNA.
--
    - SS prediction based on pairwise covariations in multiple alignments
--
    - test set: A trusted alignment of 1415 tRNA sequences.
--
    - Usage:
        - consensus SS prediction
        - database similarity searching
        - multiple sequence alignment
