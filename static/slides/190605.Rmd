## Background

- Physically interacting nucleotide pairs can be predicted by MSA

- Methods:
   - MI (local)
   - DCA (global)
       - inverting a generalized covariance matrix
       -

## DCA

---
## Data Cleaning

- 63/99 RFAM families with structure
    - 34 families: no X-RAY DIFFRACTION structures,
    - 2 families: RNA structure only "P", discarded
    
- 
  



---
## Method
- Generate MSA
    - Get RNA sequence from PDB
       - Annotate basepairs with x3dna-dssr
       - Annotate distance contacts
       - mapping PDB residues to
    - Align RFAM family sequences to 
       - Use cmalign from infernal
       - Columns not appear in the PDB were dropped
       -
