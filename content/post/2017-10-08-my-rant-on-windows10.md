## windows10 is horrific to use

I use ubuntu 16.04 on my laptop for my daily work. Windows 10 sits in my other laptop to run entertainment-related stuff, like steam games.

But my experience with windows 10 is so terrible that I've decided to dedicate this post to it.

## Confusing and hard-to-use configurations

Today, I need to set the shortcut for toggling between input methods. In ubuntu, I set F12 for this function, because there's no chance that I hit it by accident.

- I started by looking around in windows settings
- randomly clicked millions of links, options, nothing near what I expected. I spent 5 minutes roaming around without any clue where I should be looking at.
- Shit I have to google it in the end.
- *Googling*
- And it turned out to be in the CONTROL PANEL BURRIED DEEP DOWN IN SOME KIND OF ADVANCED SETTINGS IN THE SECOND PAGE,GOTCHA YOU LITTLE SHIT!
- And you have to choose between `ctrl+ alt`, `alt+ shift` and "`", nothing more?!! Why can't I set F12 for toggling? Is it too difficult to implement? Why can the ubuntu guys do it??

In summary, configurations is a nightmare in windows, even though I have used windows for more than 13 years.

Good luck in finding what you want, you will eventually have to google it for some simple task like the above one. And when you finally find it, you will probably be provided with limited options that reads at you "NO YOU CAN'T DO THIS BECAUSE I SAY SO."

## Personal preferences are randomly changed during updates

Really? MS? Really? 

I have 3 input methods installed for English, Chinese and Japanese. The shortcut for switching between them was, and had always been, `WIN+SPACE`. I've been using this for more than a year and were get used to it.

ALL OF A SUDDEN WINDOWS SOMEHOW CHANGED IT TO `ALT+SHIFT`. REALLY? MS? REALLY?

I smashed my old shortcut and nothing happened as expected in the past WHOLE YEAR!
I had to googled how to set these switch shortcut, 

 MRW I find out that it was set to `ALT+SHIFT` without any clue:

WHY?
WHAT DID I DO?
WHAT HAPPENED?

## Do we need superfetch that takes up 99% of your ram all the time?

Another day I noticed that in my task manager,  my memory usage and disk usage stay at 99% while I was not running any resource-hungry programmes

I googled and found that superfetch caused this. Basically, superfetch preload "frequenly used" data into the memory so that users can get the data immediately when requested. But as SSD gets popular, this mechanism seems obsolete, imporved little.

I disabled it and memory usage went back to normal.^[By the way, the disk usage is because of Geforce experience that "WOULD LIKE TO SCAN EVERY SINGLE FILE UNDER MY STEAM DIRECTORY EVERY TIME I REBOOT", which is also stupid.]

ALSO, I hate it when MS decided to use my computer resources to do some preloading work for what they "predicted" me doing.

STOP ASSUMING YOU KNOW WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO WITH MY COMPUTER! MICROSOFT YOU LITTLE SHIT!
