This issue of Rstudio IDE has been reported for a while but has not been fixed.

The issue is that in rstudio (>=1.1), viewing wide or long data frame,matrix in the view panel feels clunky, but lower versions (such as 1.0.153) is much smoother. ^[Actually I am making this post to show off that I can screencap a beautiful gif]

Test code:

```r
test.mat <- matrix(data=runif(2000000,0,1),nrow=20000,ncol=100)

View(test.mat)
```

View test.mat in 1.0153:

View test.mat in 1.2.687:
