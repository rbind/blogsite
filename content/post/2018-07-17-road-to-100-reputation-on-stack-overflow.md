Stack overflow has been helpful to my work for a long time. 

There are several times that I attempted to make a contribution by answering a few questions as I could. However, being a programming rookie, I find a trend that most "basic, easy and common" questions have already been asked and answered. "Later questions" only become harder, which requires more than a programming rookie(like me) to contribute.

If I don't contribute, then I don't have "reputation".

If I don't have "reputation", then I can't even upvote my favorite answers to show some gratitude.

If I can't express my gratitude to people(and their answers) that helped me, then I feel uncomfortable and guilty for not completing my part of the etiquette.

So I determine to work towards 100 reputations on SO a few weeks a go. Everyday I spend sometime to work on some questions I could manage, mostly related to R or other yihui's packages that I use(xaringan, rmarkdown, blogdown & stuff). Turns out that It only requires some time and research to make a contribution!

During this time, I've also learned a few new things:

- [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) is really cool to produce an R related reprex

- `ifelse` in [R is slow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51260196/7503413)


As of today, I've answered 12 questions in total. From which I get 316 reps, which exceeds my goal already!

I can finally upvote those answers I like.

I am happy again.
