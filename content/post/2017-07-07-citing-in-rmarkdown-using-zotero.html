<h2>Motivations</h2>
<p>The advantage of using Rmarkdown as a replacement of Word, libreoffice or other editors is tremendous and perfect in my current workflow, in which R coding, visualization are recorded for reproducibility and presentation.</p>
<p>For reports, manuscripts written in the academic style, sufficient reference is important because <del>we are scientist and that’s what we do!</del> all arguements should be backed up by evidence. In order to make the citation process painless, I did the following process and works for me (for now).</p>

<h2>Workflow of adding citations</h2>
<p>Here is a typical scenario in my writing experience where citation is needed.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>plan to write a topic or a section in the manuscript; Search a bunch of related papers, select &amp; read them roughly, organize them in my own word. <a href="">Add useful articles in my zotero library</a></p></li>
<li><p>write the part</p></li>
<li></li>
</ol>
